Personal Expense Tracker
Design and implement a dual-interface application to help users track daily expenses, analyze spending trends, and manage budgets effectively. The Add Expenses feature lets users log daily expenses through a form built with HTML, styled with CSS, and made interactive with JavaScript. Users enter details like Expense Title, Category, Amount, and Date. The data is sent to the server via a JSON REST API for storage and synchronization.
