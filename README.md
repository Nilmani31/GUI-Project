Event Registration System: 
Design and implement a dual-interface application for students to register for college events. The Event Registration feature offers a user-friendly form built with HTML, styled with CSS, and made interactive with JavaScript. Students enter details like Name, Email, Event Selection, and Date. The data is sent to the server via a REST API.
